**Credits**
- As a training and testing set of images I used images from [this](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet) project.
- For training we relied on Google Inception model - it's explained [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/inception).
- I used some code from this [tutorial](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersAndMore/TensorFlow_Tut_2_Classification_Walk-through).
